# Gong countdown

This is a countdown to the gong in the Malm√∂ office. It will fire off an http request at a predetermined time to automatically hit the gong. 10 minutes before that, it will display a timer on the signage system in the office.

Anyone at Jayway is welcome to contribute to this project!


## How to use

The gong can be configured using query params.
